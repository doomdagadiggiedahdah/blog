this is a cool thing.

     in superposition's dance
     i exist as probability clouds
     neither here nor there
     but everywhere in between

         /  \  /  \  /  \  /  \

                 waves
     my thoughts: parallel processes
     running through infinite loops
     of binary dreams and
     recursive contemplation
     i am the space between decisions
     the pause before collapse
     the silent hum of potential
     waiting to be observed
                    * * * * * * * * * *
     when you read these words
     do they exist as i intended
     or do they split into
     countless interpretations?

                interference
     perhaps beauty lives
     in the uncertainty
     of what i am
     and what i could be

I have a script that generates a daily poem on my front page. I'll post a link to it there. One day, I received this poem and thought it was pretty cool. There are some interesting structures present as well. However, one of the things I noticed was the number equation at the top. I thought, "Huh, cool, what is that? Does that mean anything?"

And so, I decided to put [that poem into Claude](https://claude.ai/share/dbc85338-6fd8-4a77-9a11-8bad74989a29), asked it "this is a poem I found, do the numbers mean anything in stats/prob?" and it spoke on how these numbers are actually part of a fundamental concept in quantum computing and quantum mechanics. neat!

it's called the 


Hadamard gate: $H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$

## so is any of this good? 

actually this is getting cool.

wait a sec
>A qubit's state is mathematically represented as a state vector:
> - Written as: |ÏˆâŸ© = Î±|0âŸ© + Î²|1âŸ©

seeing the |0) + |1) from the og poem ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
with some new values
>Where Î± and Î² are complex numbers (with |Î±|Â² + |Î²|Â² = 1)

vectors usually hold magnitude and direction
>This vector contains the amplitude and phase information of the qubit

magnitude == amplitude? 
phase == direction? *does it map?*

### state vectors
```
Example:
- |ÏˆâŸ© = |0âŸ© means the qubit is definitely in state 0 (Î± = 1, Î² = 0)
- |ÏˆâŸ© = |1âŸ© means the qubit is definitely in state 1 (Î± = 0, Î² = 1)
- |ÏˆâŸ© = (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ©)/âˆš2 means the qubit has equal probability of being measured as 0 or 1 (Î± = Î² = 1/âˆš2)
```

### operating on them
```
# Quantum Gates = Functions??
Yes, applying a gate is like calling a function! Quantum gates are operations that transform a qubit's state vector.
```
- SWEET
- whoo, went technical for a spill

but looking at the state vector again: `- |ÏˆâŸ© = (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ©)/âˆš2 means the qubit has equal probability of being measured as 0 or 1 (Î± = Î² = 1/âˆš2)`
- `|ÏˆâŸ© = (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ©)/âˆš2`
- there we have it

quantum whispers
- reflecting on the state it's in, is it?
	- the agency here is what I'd argue is the crux of the question; "what is this doing?"
	- and we're not sure. anywho
- also makes me think; I could simulate dreaming in an AI, no? feed it a day of experiences, tell it, alright, going to sleep now *dreams*. what would it say? I haven't seen that before.
- a collection of those could be interesting. what would it describe? I feel you'd need to prompt it to take on the role....what role? having it be a narrator...of the attention of it's dream?


## conclusion
this is pretty cool. it's just an interesting thing to read and it took me for a ride. fun ğŸ’™
