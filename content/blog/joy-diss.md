title: The Joy of Cognitive Dissonance
---
> "Well, all information looks like noise until you break the code." - Neal Stephenson

A mentor described "Cognitive Dissonance" to me as the feeling our brains get when something in our environment doesn't fit in with our model of how the world usually operates. In other words, *this is an opportunity to learn something.*

[Putting difficult information in front of you](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095) in order to [become more capable](https://ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/) is mostly done (I would guess) with things like literature or math, but I don't suspect people view listening to music in the same way. It's often viewed as something to be done for relaxation and something unoffensive and predictable-ish is looked for.

As a musician, this is much less normal and then only way to become a better musician is to push past what you currently know and be willing seek out those concepts that don't make sense to you. (I'd argue that this has benefits past being a better musician, such as being a more empathetic human and being able to understand greater complexities; but that's a different article.)

## a lil taste of what you can push towards

This is an example that I think is quite perfect. It looks like noise, likely you can't make sense of it, but read these instructions and keep in mind that this song *only two patterns* (one pattern has variations, but still only two patterns).
- Listen to [this entire song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF1dhYyqzEE) (on a lower volume if it's too heavy)
	- In case further links get taken down, "[The Sentinel](https://open.spotify.com/track/5TaoDjSgY09GGhYCEfYN1X?si=a42f2e6f0f2b43a8)" by Car Bomb
- (**listen before you go on to the next instruction**)
- ....
- ....
- **make sure you've listened before you go on to the next instruction!!!**
- There's a guiding pattern throughout the entire song, and it's incredibly simple.
- Listen again and again to find what it is. 
- If you give up / want to check your answer, [here is the spoiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQi-fykhzvE).


What this reminds me of is looking at a math equation and thinking "this is an absolute mess" until you look at it long enough and everything fits into place and specifically, *it's odd to you that it didn't make sense in the first place.*

For me, when I see a pattern like this and make sense of it, I can't stop raving about it it's so exciting. That one simple pattern being adjusted in simple simple ways created such a complex piece of work (at least, it appears as so). To me, this is the joy of cognitive dissonance; where you are hit with tension, but when the release hits....it's a beautiful thing.
