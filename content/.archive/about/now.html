<h1>What am I up to right now?</h1>
<ul>
<li><s>Trying to break my 121 day Anki streak</s> Now at <s>162!</s> 175! (<a href="blog/anki_links.html">more anki here</a> and <a href="blog/anki_simple.html">here!</a>)</li>
<li>Coding a lot. I went to a hackathon in June '23 and made this guy. <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/EOvk1IVAxmI?feature=share">PIZZAA</a></li>
<li>Along with everyone else, I'm excited by LLM's and in particular am interested in Embeddings, more to come.</li>
</ul>

<li>Back to the drawing board. For now.</li>

<h1>Have an idea of what I could be doing next?</h1>
<p>Check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUwVLTNKIIdTHpv6XsZmJ87PeFOv5ihD64rn_qLj6Qs/edit?usp=sharing">this "suggest my future" doc</a> I've put together with a rough list of my strengths and interests.</p>
<p>It's very possible that there's a perfect job out there for me that I haven't heard about or know that I'd be great for it.</p>
<p>If you put me in contact with my dream job, I'll pay you $1k (within the first 12 months of starting the job. I'm happy to add more terms as they come to mind or you bring them up to me.)</p>
