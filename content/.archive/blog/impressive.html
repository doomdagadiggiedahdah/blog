<h1 id="why-this-document">Why this document?</h1>
<ul>
<li>In case you want to hire me, it can be good to know I‚Äôm worth investing in.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm also quite shy, and can present myself less than perfect. So, if you read this here I don‚Äôt have to potentially butcher them in real life.</li>
<li>(But feel free to test me on any of them if you feel I‚Äôm bluffing! üòâ)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-goods">The goods</h1>
<ul>
<li>Math
<ul>
<li>Went from ‚Äúnot knowing how to do logarithms‚Äù and ‚Äúdropped out of senior high school math‚Äù to finishing Calc II in two months</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Programming
<ul>
<li>Studied for three months, worked for one month with Code for America (<a href="https://gitlab.com/code-for-nashville/clean-slate">making this</a>) and got offered my first paying coding job</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I‚Äôve been paid to play every musical instrument I‚Äôve played over 5 hours:
<ul>
<li>Bass
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57rULv59jo4">Victor Wooten</a> said I was a good bass player</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drums
<ul>
<li>Taught myself in a month (with a gig at the end for pressure testing), and continued with the band for two years</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Piano
<ul>
<li>Again in a month to play with a band, continued for one</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Guitar
<ul>
<li>Started giving lessons ~4 months after first picking it up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Singing
<ul>
<li>Became the lead singer for an hour long show with two weeks notice</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Audio Engineering:
<ul>
<li>Became one of the top engineers at my first sound company I worked for in less than two years</li>
<li>While working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Phillips">Philip Philips</a> I had to learn a rumored-be-tricky soundboard (<a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/QzkAAOSwcT5fI9v5/s-l1600.jpg">pic</a>) in 30 minutes to be monitor engineer (also a tricky position!)
<ul>
<li>(Monitors is tough because in comparison, the FOH engineer controls Left, Right, and Subs for typically musically-untrained normal people. Monitors has you in charge of at least one speaker for each member of the band (who are trained!), not to mention the egos)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cooking:
<ul>
<li>By necessity taught myself to cook (<em>or perish</em>) and have been quite satisfied with almost every meal I‚Äôve made in the last 6 years (when I cook for others, they at least agree to my face üòâ)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chess
<ul>
<li>Decided I needed work with planning and picked up chess. After a year of playing, a chess coach at the club told me I was playing as good as people who‚Äôd been playing for 10-15 years</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpersonal skills
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs hard to emphasize the difference here, people usually won‚Äôt believe me. I spent 5-6 months consciously focusing on how to get better at having conversations with people and not feeling overcome with anxiety at just about any social event I was a part of</li>
<li>(The constant meeting of new people with audio engineering helped with this significantly)</li>
<li>In general, I can now converse with about anyone I choose, and even helped work through a problem with the Hillsborough City Council to get our event back under control largely due to being able to talk about it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emotional Health
<ul>
<li>At 22, I had to take a long and quite difficult look at myself and realize that there were parts of myself that I needed to make peace with</li>
<li>With a copius amount of journaling, reading, advice, (and yeah, crying) over 3-4 months I got myself to the best place emotionally I had ever been (at that point in my life).
<ul>
<li>(Highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2hc2FLOdhI&amp;t=419s&amp;pp=ygUdZ3V5IHdpbmNoIGVtb3Rpb25hbCBmaXJzdCBhaWQ%3D">this TED talk</a> and book)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mycology
<ul>
<li>Developed an obsession and started 1. growing mushrooms (medicinal) and 2. finding out the mechanics of how they work
<ul>
<li>This helped with cooking as fermentation is closely related and brewed ginger beer, made tempeh, ate my own mushrooms, and made a tincture of Reishi mushrooms</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Writing
<ul>
<li>After reading <a href="https://tim.blog/2007/12/05/how-to-take-notes-like-an-alpha-geek-plus-my-2600-date-challenge/">this Tim Ferriss article</a> on the power of writing, I started taking writing seriously in December of 2014 and it has ruled over me since then. My typical setup has been:
<ul>
<li>One notebook for every subject I learn, one with me everywhere I go, and one for daily writing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I‚Äôve tried other forms of notetaking and have:
<ul>
<li>Over 6,000 notecards</li>
<li>A monstrosity of an Obsidian vault</li>
<li>2,784 fleeting notes (small digital notes I make on my computer, not yet ready for an Obsidian note)</li>
<li>Between 1,000-2,000 voice memos (that I transcribe to text)</li>
<li>And for the notebooks, they‚Äôre probably around 40 or so (with each of the above items as notebooks)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="essentially">Essentially,</h2>
<ul>
<li>Studying is my most favorite thing to do.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="other-non-standard-things-ive-done">Other non-standard things I‚Äôve done</h1>
<ul>
<li>I sold all of my stuff and bought a one way ticket to Ecuador (that was painful)</li>
<li>I‚Äôve never been drunk! (But have had some amount of everclear (for science))</li>
<li>Helped my dad start a home automation business</li>
<li>Found out about this thing called Effective Altruism and went to a couple conferences, decided they were putting skin in the game to make the world a better place and decided to move to a hub and get involved ‚Äúin two months, whether I had a job or not‚Äù (but I found a job)</li>
<li>I have an obsession with Anki and am currently on 177 in a row (on 2023.10.17)</li>
<li>Memorized a shuffled deck of cards (100% one time, &gt;80% 6 times)</li>
<li>Spent around 15 months studying ‚ÄúThe Book of Five Rings‚Äù, taking a full notebook‚Äôs worth of notes (at 2-3x hours, 3-4x days/week)</li>
<li>While working a charity event I noticed a bottleneck of distributing leftover supplies among the guests and put together a quick plan of a cool way to get rid of the color packets (essentially flour and food dye.) I told the staff what they should do and announced to the crowd that everyone should throw the packets at the drop of the song. They did, and an amazing cloud of color erupted from the audience. I was quite nervous at the thought of failure (in front of a few hundred people and ‚Äústealing‚Äù the event). This may be one of my more proud moments in my life because it turned out so well.</li>
