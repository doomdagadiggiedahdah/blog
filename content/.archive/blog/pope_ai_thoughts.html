<li><em>The progress of science and technology as a path to peace</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Progress in science and technology, insofar as it contributes to greater order in human society and greater fraternal communion and freedom, thus leads to the betterment of humanity and the transformation of the world.”</li>
<li>I can see some sections of this being interpreted as Manifest Destiny
<ol type="1">
<li>“When human beings, “with the aid of technology”, endeavour to make “the earth a dwelling worthy of the whole human family”, <a href="about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vatican.va%2Fcontent%2Ffrancesco%2Fen%2Fmessages%2Fpeace%2Fdocuments%2F20231208-messaggio-57giornatamondiale-pace2024.html#_ftn2">[2]</a> they carry out God’s plan and cooperate with his will to perfect creation and bring about peace among peoples."
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>they carry out God’s plan and cooperate with his will to perfect creation and bring about peace among peoples.</strong></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>recognizes the possible dangers: “At the same time, techno-scientific advances, … are placing in human hands a vast array of options, including some that may pose a risk to our survival and endanger our common home.”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>The future of artificial intelligence: between promise and risk</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>tech is not neutral, it serves the purpose of its creators desires</li>
<li>“We cannot presume a priori that its development will make a beneficial contribution to the future of humanity and to peace among peoples.”</li>
<li>“The immense expansion of technology thus needs to be accompanied by an appropriate formation in responsibility for its future development.”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>The technology of the future: machines that “learn” by themselves</em>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“Developments such as machine learning or deep learning, raise questions that transcend the realms of technology and engineering, and have to do with the deeper understanding of the meaning of human life, the construction of knowledge, and the capacity of the mind to attain truth.”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>The sense of limit in the technocratic paradigm</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>He gets the idea behind Scalable Oversight: “The faster and more complex they become, the more difficult it proves to understand why they produced a particular result.”
<ol type="1">
<li>also, “There is a risk that the criteria behind certain decisions will become less clear,”</li>
</ol></li>
<li>mentions incentives problem of tech to push forward despite risk, “In some sense, this is favoured by the technocratic system, which allies the economy with technology and privileges the criterion of efficiency, tending to ignore anything unrelated to its immediate interests.”</li>
<li>danger ahead: “This should lead us to reflect on something frequently overlooked in our current technocratic and efficiency-oriented mentality, as it is decisive for personal and social development: the “sense of limit”. Human beings are, by definition, mortal; by proposing to overcome every limit through technology, in an obsessive desire to control everything, we risk losing control over ourselves;"
<ol type="1">
<li>Longevity people aren’t happy with this one</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Burning issues for ethics</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>gets the baked in bias issues down</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Shall we turn swords into ploughshares?</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>says that machines will always be machines, does he knwo about intelligence explosion? or he believes that machines won’t become sentient</li>
<li>sense of optimism</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Challenges for education</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Users of all ages, but especially the young, need to develop a discerning approach to the use of data and content collected on the web or produced by artificial intelligence systems.”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Challenges for the development of international law</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>urging global coordination: “In this regard, I urge the global community of nations to work together in order to adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of artificial intelligence in its many forms.”</li>
<li></li>
