<li>(First a note; adding a bunch of tools can be distracting. Don’t do that.)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Official App</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083">Use this heatmap.</a> It’s motivating to know how far you’ve come (and metrics are helpful.)</li>
<li>And really, you don’t need to use <a href="https://enjoy.monster/blog/anki_simple.html">a lot of features</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-keep-the-habit">How to keep the habit</h1>
<ul>
<li>Done beats perfect. Under <a href="https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition">Habit Formation</a> this site says you <strong>have</strong> to review every day, and the reason I disagree is that if you hate doing it and you don’t resolve why it’s not working, it probably won’t get better for you (which means you may quit for good, which isn’t good).</li>
<li>If you need to, take a break.</li>
<li>Yes, it is <strong>best</strong> if you review every day.</li>
<li>Though, especially when you’re first starting out, it’s crucial to review every day (so, make sure not to overwhelm yourself by <em>forcing yourself</em> to do 100+ cards a day right off the bat. Start slow.)</li>
<li>((Start slow, especially because you’re going to learn that there are cards you’re not going to like, and if you have hundreds of those to go through, you’ll <strong>really</strong> dislike it.))</li>
<li>If you end up taking a break and have hundreds to come back to, Anki intends to first show you the overdue cards most important to review (closest to forgetting in your deck) which takes take of the “worst case”, but also the cards will still be there.</li>
<li>Personally, I say if you’re coming back from a break and there’s a huge amount of cards, you should do the amount until it feels too heavy and then do something else. (Sure, this is less helpful for test cramming, but don’t do that.)</li>
