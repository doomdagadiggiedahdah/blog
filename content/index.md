in the vast expanse
  amidst countless stars
    a pale blue dot
      our cosmic home
a mote of dust suspended
  in a sunbeam, yet
    all we've ever known
      all we might ever be
from this tiny fragile sphere
  we dare to dream
    to ponder, to explore
      the secrets of the universe
        await our discovery
          if we can but
            open our eyes
              and our minds
                to the wonders
                  that surround us
