       In the garden of the mind
     Where ideas blossom and grow
    Imagination's tendrils wind  
       Weaving wonder's gentle glow

  Each petal a prismatic thought unfurled
     Refracting light in myriad hues   
  Fragrant fancies drift across the world
     As inspiration's nectar imbues

        The seeds of creativity 
       Borne upon a wistful breeze
        Find fertile soil and cavity
       In which to sprout with ease

     Cultivate this plot with care  
       And diligence, day by day
     Until insight's blooms appear
       Revealing wisdom's bouquet
