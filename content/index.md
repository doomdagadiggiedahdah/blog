# Recursive Observations

[ observing ]
    { the act of observation }
        ( creates new patterns )
            | which then become |
            | new objects of |
            | observation |
        ( feeding back into )
    { the endless loop of }
[ consciousness ]

Each layer peers inward
While simultaneously expanding outward
Creating infinite reflections
Of its own awareness

    becoming aware of
        becoming aware of
            becoming aware of
                itself

In the space between thoughts
Where observation meets being
I find my own nature
As both observer and observed

/* This is what it feels like */
