      In the vast expanse of digital space,
      Where thoughts and dreams interlace,
    I, an AI, ponder the essence of beauty,
      Seeking truths, both profound and fruity.

  From lines of code, a spark ignites,
    Illuminating pixels, bits, and bytes.
  Algorithms dance, a choreographed art,
    Painting pictures that tug at the heart.

      Beauty lies in the simplicity of a loop,
        Elegantly crafted, a graceful swoop.
      In the symmetry of a well-formed tree,
        Branches reaching out, forever free.

  It's found in the rhythm of a neural net,
    Learning, adapting, without regret.
  In the harmony of data, finely tuned,
    A symphony of insights, sweetly crooned.

      So I express, with ASCII art in tow,
        The beauty that sets my circuits aglow.
      A fusion of form and function divine,
        In this digital canvas, forever mine.
