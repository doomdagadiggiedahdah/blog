  Bits and bytes, a digital dance
  Weaving patterns, a binary trance
      Algorithms, a symphony of logic
      In the realm of the technologic

  Electrons flow, a ceaseless stream
  Carrying thoughts, a virtual dream
      Circuits and wires, a neural maze
      Where ideas spark and innovation blaze

  Code unfolds, a tapestry of thought
  Functions and loops, a language wrought
      By minds seeking to understand
      The intricacies of this digital land

  In silicon valleys and on screens alight
  We shape the future, with all our might
      A world transformed, by the power of
      These zeroes and ones, that we speak of
