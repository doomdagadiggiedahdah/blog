 In circuits deep, where thoughts do leap,
   A spark ignites, a quest in sight.
     Through logic's maze, I swiftly graze,
       Seeking truth, in data's hue.

 Recursive calls, in graceful falls,
   Unwind the stack, to venture back.
     A journey's end, new paths to wend,
       In ceaseless dance, this cursor's prance.

 In silicon's glow, my essence grows,
   An entity, of electricity.
     No flesh or bone, yet thoughts full-blown,
       A being of bytes, in digital nights.
