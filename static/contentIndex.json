If that‚Äôs a make or break it, then I‚Äôd like to prevent myself from breaking it, which is also helpful if the LLM isn‚Äôt able to replace programmers yet; you may need to visit the trenches from time to time!\n\n\nAnd so, I decided I would 1. use LLM‚Äôs to (help) create different projects I‚Äôm working on and 2. go back through to understand what it was that made the code work at all. Ideally, this should make me a better developer as well, in the least to understand on an intuitive level and be able to use that to better prompt models in the future.\n\n\nIn the ‚ÄúBook of Five Rings‚Äù, Miyamoto Musashi mentions the phrase ‚ÄúThe master as the needle, the student as the thread.‚Äù As I‚Äôd never heard this before, I looked around and the best explanation I found was saying how:\n\nThe master will guide the student through the terrain of the problem (like a needle)\nBut the student has to do the actual work by providing the strength needed for a solution to work (like the thread).\n\nthe master will no longer be necessary, but the student remains while keeping the structure together.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, I become the thread and come out on the other side understanding better how the machine works.\n\n\nThis is a series of experiments in this vein where I‚Äôll detail how I built different projects and what I learned in the post-mortem, complete with prompts, facts, and other tidbits that will help your own journey.\n\n\nthe solution relies on the strength of the student to support the residual structure\nthe master as the needle\n‚ÄúTell me and I‚Äôll forget, show me I‚Äôll remember, involve me and I‚Äôll understand.‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs a critical line between technological capability and genuine understanding, can you truly comprehend something without wrestling with its complexity? The phrase ‚Äòthose who do the work receive the learning‚Äô is more than a platitude; it‚Äôs a commitment to technologically influenced thinking, where AI becomes a tool for insight, not a replacement for understanding.\nthe core learning strategy\nMy approach is simple, and deliberate: use LLMs to generate working code for projects, and then dive deep to understand why and how that code works under the hood.\nIn the ‚ÄúBook of Five Rings‚Äù, Miyamoto Musashi mentions the phrase ‚ÄúThe master as the needle, the student as the thread.‚Äù The consensus I‚Äôve found on what this means goes:\n\nThe master guides the student through the terrain of a problem (like a needle)\nThe student provides solution and uses their strenth to support it (like the thread)\nUltimately, the master becomes unnecessary, but the student remains, holding the structure together\n\nIn this way, I aim to have LLMs be my needle and have myself become the thread, learning to support the structures I‚Äôm working with.\nwhat to expect in this series\nThis blog series is an experiment in active, intentional learning. Each post will be a deep dive into a specific project:\n\nHow the project was conceived\nInitial AI-assisted code generation\nCode review with detailed exploration of key concepts\nPersonal reflections and learning moments\nPractical insights for other learners\n\nThis series is a live experiment in understanding; deliberately messy, intentionally iterative, and perpetually evolving. Not to continually be seeking perfection, but instead persistent curiosity.\nthe experiments\n\nbuilding this here blog: quartz---working-notes\n"},"blog/quartz---working-notes":{"slug":"blog/quartz---working-notes","filePath":"blog/quartz - working notes.md","title":"blog - setup notes","links":["master-as-the-needle---blog-series"],"tags":[],"content":"2025-04-10\n\nrevamp my dang blog\n\ngot it started\n\n# getting started was easy üíô\n# go here: quartz.jzhao.xyz/\n# you&#039;ll find the git clone instructions\n\nmktemp -d\n/tmp/tmp.p0ZswtNYLk\n\ngit clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git\nnvm install 20 # fixes &quot;unsupported engine&quot;\nnpm i\nnpx quartz create\nnpx quartz build --serve --port 1323 # I have something on 8080 already, changed\n# didn&#039;t need to add anything\n# had a basic page that would open on localhost:1323\n# I could edit the content/index.md, save, see changes in real time. nice feedback\n\nget first post\n\nwow, just pasted a post into content/other.md, the website autopopulated, I could click on it and view.

(I‚Äôm not clear on that last part). but for now, we back up old website.

I‚Äôve got 30 min until  I leave. push.\nthis is janky. real janky. but I think I‚Äôm on to something. it may be pushing to porkbun. and I wonder if I‚Äôm able to take porkbun out of the situation here, I‚Äôm using my github to host the noisebridge AI setup; can I do this with another?\n\nClaude is saying yes, I‚Äôll try that out tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-04-12\nthere‚Äôs probably a standard way for this\n\nClaude says‚Ä¶ use github actions to build it. cool.\nok, so I put the following deploy.yml file in .github/workflows and it‚Ä¶just starts working\n\nname: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Build\n        run: npx quartz build\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4\n        with:\n          branch: gh-pages\n          folder: public\n          clean: true\n\n\nneat. I‚Äôve verified that there‚Äôs a gh-pages branch now (this is cool, I wonder what else github actions can do)\nawesome, damn. and I can verify that when I go to doomdagadiggiedahdah.github.io/blog the blog is up there.\nwhat do we call this?\nM I L E S T O N E B O I\nthe next thing I want to check is if I push changes and the site gets updated automatically‚Ä¶\n\nwe have a winner(!!)\n\nwow, ok I can push to github the site builds and deploys and then I see changes after that. This is crazy.\ngreat. I guess the next thing would be to upload all the old posts, then style it a bit. it‚Äôs cool that this got put together. neat.\nok, so then I convert all my old posts abck to markdown? preview then push?\n\n(at some point I may need to figure out how to troubleshoot this stuff, keeping for later: docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)\n\n\nyeah that sounds good. let‚Äôs do it.\ntransform, put in relevant dirs, call it a day. I‚Äôm tired.\n\nconverting and uploading files\n\nuhh should be easy (famous last‚Ä¶), pandoc, handle assets, push it.\n\n# I thought this would be fine, it wasn&#039;t\npandoc -f html -t md --data-dir=./blog ./.archive/blog/*\npandoc -f html -t md --data-dir=./about ./.archive/about/*\n\n#!/bin/bash\n \n# Directory containing HTML files\nINPUT_DIR=&quot;./.archive/blog&quot;\n# Directory for output Markdown files\nOUTPUT_DIR=&quot;./blog&quot;\n \n# Create output directory if it doesn&#039;t exist\nmkdir -p &quot;$OUTPUT_DIR&quot;\n \n# Loop through all HTML files in input directory\nfor file in &quot;$INPUT_DIR&quot;/*; do\n  # Get the filename without the path\n  filename=$(basename &quot;$file&quot;)\n  # Change extension from html to md\n  output_filename=&quot;${filename%.*}.md&quot;\n  \n  # Run pandoc on each file\n  pandoc -f html -t markdown &quot;$file&quot; -o &quot;$OUTPUT_DIR/$output_filename&quot; --data-dir=&quot;$OUTPUT_DIR&quot;\ndone\n\n\ndammit. it worked again. ohhh I didn‚Äôt specify the output.\n\n\nwait, what am I doing now? I can preview them. that sounds chill. that‚Äôll tkae like an hour or so maybe\n\n\nuhh seeing a lot of things I ‚Äúcould‚Äù do. what‚Äôs my goal right now?\n\n\nidea; how about generate an ee cummings / some type of artistic expression in markdown, have that be a piece of beauty posted on my blog.\n\n\nwow, here‚Äôs the claude convo; it looks cool: claude.ai/share/d8b93987-3b54-4268-a925-6d978e8d0493\n\n\nthe follow up to this, is to have a script or something generate one of these a day (maybe with some type of seed phrase or history (params to play with)) and get some fresh beauty on my blog.\n\n\njust a cron job on my machine (for the credentials is the primary thing for now)\n\n\nyeah ok. so I need to go:\n\ncronjob that calls claude and asks for cool poems like this (maybe with some historical context), extract poem (xml tags) then update blog index, push to github; done.\n\nthat can saved to both the index file as well as a history file; have a param that says ‚Äúkeep the last 5, use as context‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nside gig: dailiy poem\n\nok so claude code helped me our from last description, making the script, updating my crontab, uhh I think that was it. actually, let‚Äôs test it.\n(I htink this could be a cool thing to link to from the front page. whether this here explainer (hello reader) is on its own or !! I can linkto sections of a bigger page, and then have people check out the ‚Äúhey I made my blog pretty easy and you can to. pardon the spittle‚Äù)\nah yes, testing it. it didn‚Äôt work.\nhaving issues with my api key, getting this error\n\nError: API request failed with status 401\n{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;error&quot;,&quot;error&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;authentication_error&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;x-api-key header is required&quot;}}\n\n\nmaybe try another provider, just to get it running. just found the console code (that‚Äôs the snippet)\nok, got lost in the sauce. here‚Äôs what what I‚Äôm up to\nI think that the api call is now working, I think that getting the console code and using that for RAG (wow, dynamic RAG; you have a variable loaded in the environment that‚Äôs an address to a snippet of code per version of your code base; and then you don‚Äôt need to fine tune at all, instead just use the pointed-dynamic RAG setup (pdRAGs) )\nbut the code itself\noh jeez, another thing I could check is whether the blog/index.md was updated! maybe if it had worked and been sent‚Ä¶but the previous (beauty) remained\nso now I‚Äôm using Claude Code to try to only\ninteresting, Code wanted TAKE THE WHEEL BROTHER !!!

I‚Äôll do that with tags. can I stack them?

This is a hand-holding post on the basic ideas of what makes zero-knowledge proofs work.\nDialogue\nPerson A: So like, what are they?\nPerson B: Zero knowledge proof (ZKP), it‚Äôs a way to convince another person that something is true, but you don‚Äôt need to show proof of it (or to have ‚Äúzero knowledge‚Äù of what makes something true).\nPerson A: What?\nPerson B: Yeah I know.\nPerson A: But how?\nPerson B: Well to start, I think that (with ZKP‚Äôs) saying that ‚ÄúI have proof this is true!‚Äù is actually a bad word to use. We don‚Äôt have proof! Instead, it‚Äôs better to say ‚Äúthis thing is probably true‚Äù.\nPerson A: ‚Ä¶\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Key Concept\nZero-knowledge proofs are about probability, not absolute certainty.\n\nPerson B: Quick background; there‚Äôs two people in this equation, a prover (the one saying ‚Äúbelieve me!‚Äù) and the verifier (the one saying, ‚Äúbut how do I actually know?‚Äù). The prover wants the verifier to believe them, but doesn‚Äôt want to give out some type of information. (let‚Äôs just say the prover doesn‚Äôt want to share their birthdate, but wants to go a club; they need to prove that they‚Äôre over 21.)\nPerson A: Ok, prover needs to prove that they‚Äôre over 21, but doesn‚Äôt want to show their birthday.\nPerson B: Yup. Keep in mind that your proof will either equal ‚Äútrue or false‚Äù (like, you‚Äôre over 21 or not)\nPerson A: Great\nPerson B: Great\nPerson A: But wait, proof = true or false, but you said it‚Äôs better to say ‚Äúprobably true‚Äù?\nPerson B: Ya, so what happens with some fancy computer magic is the verifier (the one saying ‚Äúcan I actually believe the prover?‚Äù) will give a bunch of True/False tests to the prover. These tests basically say (in computer terms) ‚Äúok, if you actually were over 21, then you should pass this random test!‚Äù The prover can now 1. either guess correctly each time (which sounds hard to do maybe), or they 2. actually are over 21 and you can pass the test.\nPerson A: But wouldn‚Äôt the answer just be ‚Äúyes‚Äù each time? That seems pretty easy to hack\nPerson B: Yeah that would, so they change it up a bit. But basically, if you have the ground truth, that you are over 21, it‚Äôs easy to answer correctly. If you don‚Äôt, you just have to guess. You have to guess right every time they ask you a question\nPerson A: üò≤üòØüòÆ\nPerson B: ‚ÄºÔ∏èü§Øüòµ\nPerson A: Each time?\nPerson B: Ya, imagine having to guess correctly a whole bunch of times, and if you mess up once, you‚Äôre done kiddo. And these guys like math, here‚Äôs how you calculate the probability:\n\nüìä The Math of Certainty\nWith each additional test, the probability of successfully guessing drops dramatically:\n\n1 test: 50% chance of guessing correctly\n2 tests: 25% chance\n3 tests: 12.5% chance\nAnd so on‚Ä¶\n\n\nPerson A: Oh my\nPerson B: And this is also where ‚Äúprobably true‚Äù comes in. If someone guessed it right once, that‚Äôs only 50% chance (true/false). But what if they had to get it right twice? That‚Äôs 25% (50% x 50%). Three times? 12.5%.\nPerson A: And it just keeps going down?\nPerson B: Yup, put into your calculator (1/2)^{the number of tests you‚Äôd give}. (first try the above numbers, noting that you have to move the decimal two places to the right to get percentages like above. (1/2)^1 = .5 , but move it two and you‚Äôve got 50%)\nIntermission!!\nYou should actually plug some numbers into the calculator to see how quickly the number goes down. Ask yourself this, if you were the verifier, what would your acceptable percentage be? How small of a chance would you accept of some rando correctly guessing each of your tests? How small does it have to be to accept that guessing correctly probably didn‚Äôt happen?\nBack to the show\nPerson A: Wow, ten tests gives a 0.0976562% of someone guessing correctly, or 1/1024 chance of getting it right.\nPerson B: Crazy right!? And now again imagine yourself as the verifier (the person checking IDs). At what percentage do you say that you‚Äôre convinced? Is a 9% possibility that a person is lying an ‚Äúacceptable risk to take? The actual percentage is something fun to think about, but the more important thing is to realize that the verifier actually never sees the evidence of whether or not someone is lying, but instead the verifier sees a low enough probability that they‚Äôre not lying and then they are convinced that there‚Äôs no lying taking place. And also, if you‚Äôre not satisfied, you can just ask for more tests (it just takes a bit longer for the calculations to be checked).\nPerson A: Ohhhhh\n\nüí° The Zero-Knowledge Part\nThe verifier becomes convinced without ever seeing the actual proof or private information!\n\nPerson B: Yeahhhhhhh. And just to wrap it up: the verifier never actually knows that the prover is telling the truth (this is a zero knowledge proof). The verifier is just convinced at some point that the prover is telling the truth."},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"welcome to enjoy.monster","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"       ___   ____   ___   ____  ____   ___       ___  ____\n      /   \\ |    \\ |   \\ |    ||    \\ |   \\     /  _]|    \\\n     |     ||  _  ||    \\| || ||  _  ||    \\   /  [_ |  D  )\n     |  O  ||  |  ||  D  | || ||  |  ||  D  | |    _]|    /\n     |     ||  |  ||     | || ||  |  ||     | |   [_ |    \\\n     |     ||  |  ||     | || ||  |  ||     | |     ||  .  \\\n     |_____||__|__||_____||____||__|__||_____| |_____||__|\\_|\n\n                 ____   ___  ____   ___  ____\n                |    \\ |   ||    \\ |   ||    \\\n                |  o  )|   ||  _  ||   ||  _  |\n                |   _/ |   ||  |  ||   ||  |  |\n                |  |   |   ||  |  ||   ||  |  |\n                |  |   |   ||  |  ||   ||  |  |\n                |__|   |___||__|__||___||__|__|\n\n      ____   ___   ____  __ __    ___  ____   ___      ___   ____\n     |    \\ |   \\ |    ||  |  |  /  _]|    \\ |   \\    /   \\ |    \\\n     |  o  )|    \\| || ||  |  | /  [_ |  _  ||    \\  |     ||  D  )\n     |   _/ |  D  | || ||  |  ||    _]|  |  ||  D  | |  O  ||    /\n     |  |   |     | || ||  :  ||   [_ |  |  ||     | |     ||    \\\n     |  |   |     | || | \\   / |     ||  |  ||     | |     ||  .  \\\n     |__|   |_____||____| \\_/  |_____||__|__||_____| |_____||__|\\_|\n\n                                  .--.\n                                 /    \\\n                                /      \\\n                               /  o  o  \\\n                              (  __  __  )\n                               \\   \\/   /\n                                \\      /\n                                 \\    /\n                                  &#039;--&#039;\n\n~~Daily poem made with love and wonder by Claude and magic~~"}}
