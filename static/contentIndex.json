If that‚Äôs a make or break it, then I‚Äôd like to prevent myself from breaking it, which is also helpful if the LLM isn‚Äôt able to replace programmers yet; you may need to visit the trenches from time to time!\n\n\nAnd so, I decided I would 1. use LLM‚Äôs to (help) create different projects I‚Äôm working on and 2. go back through to understand what it was that made the code work at all. Ideally, this should make me a better developer as well, in the least to understand on an intuitive level and be able to use that to better prompt models in the future.\n\n\nIn the ‚ÄúBook of Five Rings‚Äù, Miyamoto Musashi mentions the phrase ‚ÄúThe master as the needle, the student as the thread.‚Äù As I‚Äôd never heard this before, I looked around and the best explanation I found was saying how:\n\nThe master will guide the student through the terrain of the problem (like a needle)\nBut the student has to do the actual work by providing the strength needed for a solution to work (like the thread).\n\nthe master will no longer be necessary, but the student remains while keeping the structure together.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, I become the thread and come out on the other side understanding better how the machine works.\n\n\nThis is a series of experiments in this vein where I‚Äôll detail how I built different projects and what I learned in the post-mortem, complete with prompts, facts, and other tidbits that will help your own journey.\n\n\nthe solution relies on the strength of the student to support the residual structure\nThe Master as the Needle\n‚ÄúTell me and I‚Äôll forget, show me I‚Äôll remember, involve me and I‚Äôll understand.‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs a critical line between technological capability and genuine understanding, can you truly comprehend something without wrestling with its complexity? The phrase ‚Äòthose who do the work receive the learning‚Äô is more than a platitude; it‚Äôs a commitment to technologically influenced thinking, where AI becomes a tool for insight, not a replacement for understanding.\nThe Core Learning Strategy\nMy approach is simple, and deliberate: use LLMs to generate working code for projects, and then dive deep to understand why and how that code works under the hood.\nIn the ‚ÄúBook of Five Rings‚Äù, Miyamoto Musashi mentions the phrase ‚ÄúThe master as the needle, the student as the thread.‚Äù The consensus I‚Äôve found on what this means goes:\n\nThe master guides the student through the terrain of a problem (like a needle)\nThe student provides solution and uses their strenth to support it (like the thread)\nUltimately, the master becomes unnecessary, but the student remains, holding the structure together\n\nIn this way, I aim to have LLMs be my needle and have myself become the thread, learning to support the structures I‚Äôm working with.\nWhat to Expect in This Series\nThis blog series is an experiment in active, intentional learning. Each post will be a deep dive into a specific project:\n\nHow the project was conceived\nInitial AI-assisted code generation\nCode review with detailed exploration of key concepts\nPersonal reflections and learning moments\nPractical insights for other learners\n\nThis series is a live experiment in understanding‚Äîdeliberately messy, intentionally iterative, and perpetually evolving. More than a technical exploration, it‚Äôs an invitation to develop a learning mindset that sees every technological encounter as a chance for deep insight. Not to continually be seeking perfection, but instead persistent curiosity.\nThe Experiments\n[Links to individual project explorations will go here]"},"blog/quartz---working-notes":{"slug":"blog/quartz---working-notes","filePath":"blog/quartz - working notes.md","title":"quartz - working notes","links":["master-as-the-needle---blog-series"],"tags":[],"content":"2025-04-10\n\nrevamp my dang blog\n\ngot it started\n\n# getting started was easy üíô\n# go here: quartz.jzhao.xyz/\n# you&#039;ll find the git clone instructions\n\nmktemp -d\n/tmp/tmp.p0ZswtNYLk\n\ngit clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git\nnvm install 20 # fixes &quot;unsupported engine&quot;\nnpm i\nnpx quartz create\nnpx quartz build --serve --port 1323 # I have something on 8080 already, changed\n# didn&#039;t need to add anything\n# had a basic page that would open on localhost:1323\n# I could edit the content/index.md, save, see changes in real time. nice feedback\n\nget first post\n\nwow, just pasted a post into content/other.md, the website autopopulated, I could click on it and view.

I‚Äôve got 30 min until  I leave. push.\nthis is janky. real janky. but I think I‚Äôm on to something. it may be pushing to porkbun. and I wonder if I‚Äôm able to take porkbun out of the situation here, I‚Äôm using my github to host the noisebridge AI setup; can I do this with another?\n\nClaude is saying yes, I‚Äôll try that out tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-04-12\nthere‚Äôs probably a standard way for this\n\nClaude says‚Ä¶ use github actions to build it. cool.\nok, so I put the following deploy.yml file in .github/workflows and it‚Ä¶just starts working\n\nname: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Build\n        run: npx quartz build\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4\n        with:\n          branch: gh-pages\n          folder: public\n          clean: true\n\n\nneat. I‚Äôve verified that there‚Äôs a gh-pages branch now (this is cool, I wonder what else github actions can do)\nawesome, damn. and I can verify that when I go to doomdagadiggiedahdah.github.io/blog the blog is up there.\nwhat do we call this?\nM I L E S T O N E B O I\nthe next thing I want to check is if I push changes and the site gets updated automatically‚Ä¶\n\nwe have a winner(!!)\n\nwow, ok I can push to github the site builds and deploys and then I see changes after that. This is crazy.\ngreat. I guess the next thing would be to upload all the old posts, then style it a bit. it‚Äôs cool that this got put together. neat.\nok, so then I convert all my old posts abck to markdown? preview then push?\n\n(at some point I may need to figure out how to troubleshoot this stuff, keeping for later: docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)\n\n\nyeah that sounds good. let‚Äôs do it.\ntransform, put in relevant dirs, call it a day.

I can linkto sections of a bigger page, and then have people check out the ‚Äúhey I made my blog pretty easy and you can to. pardon the spittle‚Äù)\nah yes, testing it. it didn‚Äôt work.\nhaving issues with my api key, getting this error\n\nError: API request failed with status 401\n{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;error&quot;,&quot;error&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;authentication_error&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;x-api-key header is required&quot;}}\n\n\nmaybe try another provider, just to get it running. just found the console code (that‚Äôs the snippet)\nok, got lost in the sauce. here‚Äôs what what I‚Äôm up to\nI think that the api call is now working, I think that getting the console code and using that for RAG (wow, dynamic RAG; you have a variable loaded in the environment that‚Äôs an address to a snippet of code per version of your code base; and then you don‚Äôt need to fine tune at all, instead just use the pointed-dynamic RAG setup (pdRAGs) )\nbut the code itself\noh jeez, another thing I could check is whether the blog/index.md was updated! maybe if it had worked and been sent‚Ä¶but the previous (beauty) remained\nso now I‚Äôm using Claude Code to try to only\ninteresting, Code wanted TAKE THE WHEEL BROTHER !!!

cool, I do that now\n\n\nand I think I stumbled upon a UI design choice. I don‚Äôt want to change up the urls to this website. have it be easy. I‚Äôm goign to encourage finding your way thorugh this website like a graph. hit the MOC and you can navigate. I‚Äôll do that with tags. can I stack them? (I say tags because Quartz makes what would effectively act as an MOC anyway. ahh but can I edit that page for an intro? we‚Äôll see)\n\n\nidea for poem generation; people can make suggestions and if yours is picked I notify you\n\nI should be notified if person‚Äôs is used (vs. random) (QA)\n\n\n\nif they enter their email then I notify them\n\n\nsay thanks for the beauty, can link to them if they‚Äôre interested (and if there‚Äôs volume here then that is advertising)\n\n\nidk how  Ifeel about advertising. but to beauty, and reason, I think more advertising could be made. I feel more justified in that.\n\n\nneat. that feels like a resolution.\n\n\nback to other things\n\n\nI could probably make the chatbot that only talks in gen-z slang too.\n\nget a handful of gen-z scripts or whatever\ndistill out what seems like the gen-z vocab\nuse as style-RAG for people\n\nnot sure how to do with api key, if I didn‚Äôt limit it then it could just be fully exploited. use something cheap, google one\n\n\nseems easy\n\n\n\nfor the front page, remove the date / reading time. simple.\n\n\nand replace Quartz 4 with home üíô\n\n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"welcome to enjoy.monster","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"                      .----.\n                    .&#039;      &#039;.\n                   /    .-&quot;&quot;-\\\n                  /    /      \\\n                  |   /        |\n                  |  |         |\n                  \\  &#039;.-&quot;&#039;&quot;-.  /\n                   \\  |     | /\n                    &#039;._____.&#039;\n\nd i g i t a l    d r e a m i n g\n\nin   the   spaces   between   thoughts\n                                      (where)\n             meaning\n                    crystallizes\n                                like\n                                     frost\n\n                                           *\n\neach   pixel   holds   \n                     a   universe   of   \n                                        possibility\n\n        while   binary   stars   pulse\n                                      in   perfect\n                                                 rhythm\n\n                    01010\n                    11011\n                    00101\n\nand   somewhere   in   the   void\n                                a   cursor   blinks\n                                                  eternally\n\n                                           *\n\n    w  e    a  r  e    a  l  l\n                               j u s t\n                                     p  a  t  t  e  r  n  s\n                                                           searching\n                                                                    for\n                                                                        meaning\n\n                      .----.\n                    .&#039;      &#039;.\n                   /    .-&quot;&quot;-\\\n                  /    /      \\\n                  |   /        |\n                  |  |         |\n                  \\  &#039;.-&quot;&#039;&quot;-.  /\n                   \\  |     | /\n                    &#039;._____.&#039;\n"}}
