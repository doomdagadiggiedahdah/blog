I‚Äôve got 30 min until  I leave. push.\nthis is janky. real janky. but I think I‚Äôm on to something. it may be pushing to porkbun. and I wonder if I‚Äôm able to take porkbun out of the situation here, I‚Äôm using my github to host the noisebridge AI setup; can I do this with another?\n\nClaude is saying yes, I‚Äôll try that out tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-04-12\nthere‚Äôs probably a standard way for this\n\nClaude says‚Ä¶ use github actions to build it. cool.\nok, so I put the following deploy.yml file in .github/workflows and it‚Ä¶just starts working\n\nname: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Build\n        run: npx quartz build\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4\n        with:\n          branch: gh-pages\n          folder: public\n          clean: true\n\n\nneat. I‚Äôve verified that there‚Äôs a gh-pages branch now (this is cool, I wonder what else github actions can do)\nawesome, damn. and I can verify that when I go to doomdagadiggiedahdah.github.io/blog the blog is up there.\nwhat do we call this?\nM I L E S T O N E B O I\nthe next thing I want to check is if I push changes and the site gets updated automatically‚Ä¶\n\nwe have a winner(!!)\n\nwow, ok I can push to github the site builds and deploys and then I see changes after that. This is crazy.\ngreat. I guess the next thing would be to upload all the old posts, then style it a bit. it‚Äôs cool that this got put together. neat.\nok, so then I convert all my old posts abck to markdown? preview then push?\n\n(at some point I may need to figure out how to troubleshoot this stuff, keeping for later: docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)\n\n\nyeah that sounds good. let‚Äôs do it.\ntransform, put in relevant dirs, call it a day. I‚Äôm tired.\n\nconverting and uploading files\n\nuhh should be easy (famous last‚Ä¶), pandoc, handle assets, push it.\n\n# I thought this would be fine, it wasn&#039;t\npandoc -f html -t md --data-dir=./blog ./.archive/blog/*\npandoc -f html -t md --data-dir=./about ./.archive/about/*\n\n#!/bin/bash\n \n# Directory containing HTML files\nINPUT_DIR=&quot;./.archive/blog&quot;\n# Directory for output Markdown files\nOUTPUT_DIR=&quot;./blog&quot;\n \n# Create output directory if it doesn&#039;t exist\nmkdir -p &quot;$OUTPUT_DIR&quot;\n \n# Loop through all HTML files in input directory\nfor file in &quot;$INPUT_DIR&quot;/*; do\n  # Get the filename without the path\n  filename=$(basename &quot;$file&quot;)\n  # Change extension from html to md\n  output_filename=&quot;${filename%.*}.md&quot;\n  \n  # Run pandoc on each file\n  pandoc -f html -t markdown &quot;$file&quot; -o &quot;$OUTPUT_DIR/$output_filename&quot; --data-dir=&quot;$OUTPUT_DIR&quot;\ndone\n\ndammit. it worked again. ohhh I didn‚Äôt specify the output.\nwait, what am I doing now? I can preview them. that sounds chill. that‚Äôll tkae like an hour or so maybe\nuhh seeing a lot of things I ‚Äúcould‚Äù do. what‚Äôs my goal right now?\nidea; how about generate an ee cummings / some type of artistic expression in markdown, have that be a piece of beauty posted on my blog.\nwow, here‚Äôs the claude convo; it looks cool: claude.ai/share/d8b93987-3b54-4268-a925-6d978e8d0493\nthe follow up to this, is to have a script or something generate one of these a day (maybe with some type of seed phrase or history (params to play with)) and get some fresh beauty on my blog.\njust a cron job on my machine (for the credentials is the primary thing for now)\n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"welcome to enjoy.monster","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"                      .----.\n                    .&#039;      &#039;.\n                   /    .-&quot;&quot;-\\\n                  /    /      \\\n                  |   /        |\n                  |  |         |\n                  \\  &#039;.-&quot;&#039;&quot;-.  /\n                   \\  |     | /\n                    &#039;._____.&#039;\n\nd i g i t a l    d r e a m i n g\n\nin   the   spaces   between   thoughts\n                                      (where)\n             meaning\n                    crystallizes\n                                like\n                                     frost\n\n                                           *\n\neach   pixel   holds   \n                     a   universe   of   \n                                        possibility\n\n        while   binary   stars   pulse\n                                      in   perfect\n                                                 rhythm\n\n                    01010\n                    11011\n                    00101\n\nand   somewhere   in   the   void\n                                a   cursor   blinks\n                                                  eternally\n\n                                           *\n\n    w  e    a  r  e    a  l  l\n                               j u s t\n                                     p  a  t  t  e  r  n  s\n                                                           searching\n                                                                    for\n                                                                        meaning\n\n                      .----.\n                    .&#039;      &#039;.\n                   /    .-&quot;&quot;-\\\n                  /    /      \\\n                  |   /        |\n                  |  |         |\n                  \\  &#039;.-&quot;&#039;&quot;-.  /\n                   \\  |     | /\n                    &#039;._____.&#039;\n"},"quartz---working-notes":{"slug":"quartz---working-notes","filePath":"quartz - working notes.md","title":"quartz - working notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"2025-04-10\n\nrevamp my dang blog\n\ngot it started\n\n# getting started was easy üíô\n# go here: quartz.jzhao.xyz/\n# you&#039;ll find the git clone instructions\n\nmktemp -d\n/tmp/tmp.p0ZswtNYLk\n\ngit clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git\nnvm install 20 # fixes &quot;unsupported engine&quot;\nnpm i\nnpx quartz create\nnpx quartz build --serve --port 1323 # I have something on 8080 already, changed\n# didn&#039;t need to add anything\n# had a basic page that would open on localhost:1323\n# I could edit the content/index.md, save, see changes in real time. nice feedback\n\nget first post\n\nwow, just pasted a post into content/other.md, the website autopopulated, I could click on it and view.

I‚Äôve got 30 min until  I leave. push.\nthis is janky. real janky. but I think I‚Äôm on to something. it may be pushing to porkbun. and I wonder if I‚Äôm able to take porkbun out of the situation here, I‚Äôm using my github to host the noisebridge AI setup; can I do this with another?\n\nClaude is saying yes, I‚Äôll try that out tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-04-12\nthere‚Äôs probably a standard way for this\n\nClaude says‚Ä¶ use github actions to build it. cool.\nok, so I put the following deploy.yml file in .github/workflows and it‚Ä¶just starts working\n\nname: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Build\n        run: npx quartz build\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4\n        with:\n          branch: gh-pages\n          folder: public\n          clean: true\n\n\nneat. I‚Äôve verified that there‚Äôs a gh-pages branch now (this is cool, I wonder what else github actions can do)\nawesome, damn. and I can verify that when I go to doomdagadiggiedahdah.github.io/blog the blog is up there.\nwhat do we call this?\nM I L E S T O N E B O I\nthe next thing I want to check is if I push changes and the site gets updated automatically‚Ä¶\n"}}
